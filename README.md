## Project Proposal

- **American Football**

  - With football fans stuck at home, we wanted to build a fun
    messaging and blogging website on the current NFL Football season
    that would allow fans to celebrate the games with others. Individual's
    will have the ability to build their own custom profile page based on
    their favorite team with our provided templates. On their page they
    will have the ability to post comments/news links on the current
    games. They will also receive notifications on post made by others
    based game matchups. The page will also have game statistics.

  2. Create User Profile based on Google Authentication
  3. Users will be able to update their profile (Nickname, Personal Image, or Avatar)
  4. Users Customize their profile page based on their favorite NFL Team provided by the Websiteâ€™s Image Library
  5. Users have the capability to post on their page with links to articles
  6. Users will have the capability to establish friendships based on the same favorite team
  7. Users have the capability to establish temporary friendships based on the weekly matchups
  8. Users will have capability to comment on another friendship post
  9. Establish disclaimer on freedom of speech (what is allowed and not allowed) and how it is enforced
  10. Establish how to use copy written material (Team Logos and Player Images)
