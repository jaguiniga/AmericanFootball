         or another brand owned or licensed by PJ'S.</p>
         
     <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND ANY SPECIFIC AND/OR SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING PJ'S 
        PRODUCTS. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF PJ'S PRODUCTS IN GENERAL. <strong>BY USING PJ'S YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ANY SPECIFIC AND/OR SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOUR USE OF 
        PJ'S PRODUCTS IS ALSO GOVERNED BY OUR <NavLink exact activeClassName="active-link" to="/privacy">PRIVACY POLICY </NavLink>.</strong></p>

                       YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT.</strong></p>


    <h4>1. These Terms of Use Are a Contract Between You and Us</h4>
       <p> A. Binding Contract. These terms of use (“Agreement”) are a contract between you and PJ's, 
        as a Washington State limited liability company 
        and its affiliates and subsidiaries. Other than as expressly stated herein, there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Contract.</p>

    <p> B. Agreement. You represent to PJ'S that you have read, understood, and expressly agree to be bound by this Agreement, 
         and the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein, whether you have created a PJ'S account 
         (and agree to this Agreement at the time you created that account) or whether you simply browse, 
         use, or access a PJ'S Product offered directly by PJ'S or through a third party (and agree to this Agreement when you browse, use, or access any aspect of the PJ'S SITE). 
         If you do not agree to the Agreement, you may not use the PJ'S Products.</p>

    <p> C. Supplemental Terms. This Agreement governs the PJ'S SITE in general. More specific and/or supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Products, 
          including but not limited to, a particular contest, software, application, promotional code, service or other activity; availability of certain merchandise, 
          content, programs, or other activities; conditions or other limitations to the PJ'S SITE for users under certain ages; and/or specific terms or restrictions 
          that may accompany certain territories, programs, content, products, websites, applications or other software. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition 
          to this Agreement and, in the event of a conflict, the supplemental terms will prevail over this Agreement. If you do not agree to the applicable supplemental terms 
          and conditions disclosed, you may not use the PJ'S Product.</p>

     <p> D. Amendments. We may need to make changes to any portion of this Agreement from time to time and for many reasons, including to reflect updates to the PJ'S Products or 
          changes in law. If we make a material change to this Agreement, it will be effective thirty (30) days following either our dispatch of a notice to you or our posting of 
          the amended terms through the PJ'S SITE, the third party that makes PJ'S SITE available to you, or at pjstermsofuse.com. You are responsible for periodically 
          reviewing this Agreement for updates and amendments. By continuing to use PJ"S Products you will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted any amendments. If you do not agree 
          to any change to this Agreement, you must discontinue using the PJ'S Products. Our customer service representatives are not authorized to modify any provision of this Agreement, 
          either verbally or in writing.</p>

          is accurate, current and complete, including your contact information for notices and other communications from us and your payment information. You agree not to impersonate or

          guardian.</p>

     <p> F. Passwords and Security. You agree that you will not share your account or account information with others. You are responsible for taking reasonable steps to maintain the 
           confidentiality of your username and password, and you are responsible for all activities under your account that you can reasonably control. You agree to promptly notify us of any 
           unauthorized use of your username, password or other account information, or of any other breach of security that you become aware of involving your account or the PJ"S Products.</p>

    <p> H. Termination or Suspension. We may terminate or suspend your access to any PJ'S Products, and/or terminate this Agreement subject to the survival of terms as provided below, 
           if required by law, or if we have objective reason to believe you have used the PJ'S Products in violation of any provision of this Agreement or any supplemental terms, and/or 
           if you engage in or encourage infringement or any other illegal conduct as it relates to your use of the PJ'S  Products.</p>

         <p> The PJ'S Products, including, but not limited to, movies, television shows, entertainment or informational programming, trailers, bonus material, scripts, code, images and artwork, 
          are our copyrighted, patented or trademarked property or the copyrighted, patented or trademarked property of our licensors and all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, 
          trade dress, patents and other intellectual property rights in the PJ'S SITE are owned by us or our licensors (who may be third-party beneficiaries of this contract) and protected 
          by the copyright, trademark, patent and other laws of the United States and international treaties.</p>

       <p>  A. Consumer License. If a PJ'S Product, or third party providing PJ'S Products subject to this Agreement, is configured to enable the use of software, content, virtual items or other 
          materials owned or licensed by us, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to access and use in the United States such software, content,

          content, virtual items or other materials and/or services to you. Likewise, the purchase of a license to use any PJ'S Product does not create an ownership interest in the PJ'S websites,

   <p>We will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the PJ'S SITE that are reported to our designated copyright agent, in accordance with the 
   U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) or, as applicable, other laws. With respect to PJ'S SITE hosted in the United States, these notices must include the 
   required information set forth in the DMCA and described in detail here.</p>

<h8><strong>5. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></h8>
     <p> <strong>PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</strong> Neither you nor PJ'S will seek to have a dispute heard as 
      a class action or private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding 
      can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitrations or proceedings.</p>

     <p>You and PJ"S agree to arbitrate, as provided below, all disputes between you (including any related disputes involving The PJ'S Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates), that are 
   not resolved informally, except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights. “Dispute” includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, 
   whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and us concerning the PJ'S SITE or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. 
   You and PJ'S empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this contract, 
   including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Agreement are void or voidable.</p>

   <p>A. In the event of a dispute, you or PJ'S must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information 
  of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute to PJ'S,  <strong>Attention: Legal.</strong> We will 
  send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and PJ'S  will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from 
  the date the notice of dispute is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. You may instead litigate a dispute in small claims 
  court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p>

   <p>B. If you and PJ'S do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision 
      will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. <strong>YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> Arbitration 
      will be administered by JAMS Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services (“JAMS”) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”). The JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an 
      arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. Proceedings that cannot 
      be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, will take place in Seattle, Washington; provided, however, that if circumstances prevent you from traveling to Seattle, 
      JAMS may hold an in-person hearing in your hometown area. You and PJ'S agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Seattle, Washington  in order to compel arbitration, 
      to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, 
      including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>

    <p>In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or PJ'S) is responsible for paying the filing fee. However, if the arbitrator issues you an award of damages and: 
        (a) that award is greater than the amount of our last written settlement offer; or 
        (b) if we did not make a settlement offer, then in addition to paying for any JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services, 
        we will reimburse you for the filing fees you incurred.</p>
  
    <p>Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed as consent by PJ'S 
       to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes, claims or controversies unrelated to the PJ'S SITE or this Agreement.</p>

<h9><strong>6. Additional Provisions</strong></h9>
<p>A. Choice of Forum. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only 
      in the state or federal courts located in Seattle, Washington United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such 
      courts for the purposes of litigating such action.</p>

<p>B. Choice of Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the United States, 
      without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>

<p>C. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the
